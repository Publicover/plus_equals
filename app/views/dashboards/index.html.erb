      <p>We build web apps. Think of it as any website that needs to get
        information from a database, or one that needs to send automated emails.</p>
      <p>But it's more than that. We build APIs too, which give any website the
        ability to interface with a database.</p>
      <p>All our projects are completed with the understanding that you want the
        best product possible. Which includes writing code that is clean,
        maintainable and easy for future collaborators to update.</p>
      <p>All our designs take the back end of the app into account. We're
        builders, not designers—but, thanks to our extensive experience as
        freelancers, we have access to the top talent in whatever a
        medium-to-large company could need.</p>
